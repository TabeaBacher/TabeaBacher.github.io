	<p>My name is Tabea Bacher. <br>
		 I joined the 
		<a href="https://www.mis.mpg.de/">MPI MiS

		</a> 
		in November 2021 to work for the Mathematical Research Data Initiative (MaRDI),
	where I support the initiative's outreach, community integration and workshop organization.
	I am a mathematician by training, got my diploma in Mathematics at the University of Leipzig 
	and like to communicate and organize events, so I am happy to combine all of that in my position as 
	MaRDI's Dissemination Coordinator. Since Summer 2022 I am one of the maintainers of <a href="https://mathrepo.mis.mpg.de/">MathRepo </a>, the repository for mathematical research-data by MPI MiS.
